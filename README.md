Just a little project I wanted to work on that helps planning when to farm mats and how to allocate resin efficiently for the characters you have and want to develop.

A lot of the Genshin Impact assets/ideas I'm using in this app have been obtained/inspired from the following websites/articles:
- [Genshin Impact Wikia](https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Genshin_Impact_Wiki)
- [genshin.gg](https://genshin.gg/)
- [genshin.cc](https://genshin.cc/)
- [Original idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/comments/jcgfh8/daily_domain_drop_cheat_sheet/)

# FAQs
**Q: Where is Sunday?**  
A: Sunday has not been included since you can farm every material a domain usually drops on the weekdays.

**Q: Why is Traveller (MC) not in the chart?**  
A: Traveller (MC) requires a lot of books from different regions depending on the element he/she is in. For example, Anemo traveller requires 3 Green Freedom books to upgrade level 1 talents, but 2 Blue Resistance books to upgrade level 2 talents.

**Q: Can you show the weapons instead?**  
A: That will be hard without making the page become huge. Different weapons require different materials even in the same category. For example, Prototype Archaic requires Aerosite, but Wolf's Gravestone requires Shackles, even if both are Claymores. If you toggle personalisation on the Drops section, and if you set up your characters and weapons properly, you'll see which character needs which weapon ascension material. I think that should be more useful.

**Q: This and that character is not listed. Can you add them? When will you add them?**  
A: I will add characters that get released as soon as possible. If I forgot for some reason and you can't wait, feel free to add me on discord (my tag is Unknown008) and leave me a message.

**Q: There's this bug in your app. How do I report it?**  
A: You can create a [new issue on the GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Unknown008/genshin-mats/issues/new) or reach me on my [discord](https://discord.gg/UsMBKxa) or send me a DM to my discord tag (Unknown008). Do be aware that timezones are a thing and that I have a full time job, so I may take some time to reply.

**Q: I have these and those great suggestions! How go I go about telling you so you can add them?**  
A: It's great that you have suggestions. I don't know if I'm skilled enough to implement them, but feel free to reach me on the links from the previous question.

I would like to thank miHoYo for making Genshin Impact, it's a game I've been enjoying a lot, *cough* despite the game being a bit stingy on drop rates *cough*, but it's fine with me. I guess I'll keep playing this game for a while, while trying to get the characters I got to where I want them to be.  

I would also like to thank [Enzokie](https://github.com/orgs/ProjectDex/people/rhexgomez) who was the one to convince me to play (I heard a bit about Genshin before I started playing but my laptop isn't the best so I already had second thoughts before trying to play a game I might not be able to play in the first place), who's been a great support both in game and outside the game, and who's been a bit of my guinea pig in testing the website before I publicly announced it.
